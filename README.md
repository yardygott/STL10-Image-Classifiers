# STL10-Image-Classifiers

This project implements a complete deep learning pipeline for classifying images from the STL-10 dataset using various architectures (Logistic Regression, Fully Connected, CNNs, and MobileNet). The pipeline includes data augmentation, training with validation splitting, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.

## 🚀 Quick Start (How to Run)

Follow these steps in order to easily run the project from start to finish:

1. **Get the Data**: Download the STL-10 dataset (~2.5GB) and prepare DataLoaders.

2. **Visualize (Optional)**: Generate augmentation samples and class grids. Results are saved in `plots and outputs/`.

3. **Configure Model**: Open `config.py` and set your desired `MODEL_TYPE`. Available options:
   * `'logistic'`: Basic Logistic Regression.
   * `'fc'`: Fully Connected (FC) Neural Network (MLP).
   * `'cnn'`: Simple Convolutional Neural Network.
   * `'mobilenet_fixed'`: MobileNetV2 as a fixed feature extractor (only the head is trained).
   * `'mobilenet_learned'`: MobileNetV2 with full fine-tuning (all weights are updated).

4. **Train**: Run the training script. The best model and curves will be saved in `plots and outputs/`.

5. **Evaluate**: Test the model on unseen data. This generates a classification report and a confusion matrix in `plots and outputs/`.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Fix Windows DLL Errors (for windows users only)
To prevent `DLL load failed` on Windows:
* Install **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)**: [Download here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
* **Restart your computer** after installation.

### 2. Virtual Environment & Dependencies
**Choose the installation command based on your hardware:**

**Option A: For standard laptops (CPU-only)**
```bash
python -m venv venv

pip install torch torchvision --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B: For machines with NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
